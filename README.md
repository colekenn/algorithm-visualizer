# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web app that visualizes sorting algorithms through smooth, real-time D3.js animations.  
Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

**Live Demo:** [algorithm-visualizer-nu-seven.vercel.app](https://algorithm-visualizer-nu-seven.vercel.app/)

## Overview
This project visualizes how sorting algorithms work step-by-step.  
Each algorithm generates a sequence of operations (comparisons, swaps, overwrites), and D3.js turns those into animated bar movements.  
You can adjust the array size, change animation speed, and switch between algorithms to see how they differ in action.

## Features
- Merge Sort and Quick Sort visualizations  
- Adjustable speed and array size  
- Play / Pause / Step-through controls  
- Color-coded comparisons and swaps  
- Built with a clean React + D3 integration pattern

## Future Improvements
- Add Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- Display step-by-step explanations or operation counters  
- Dark mode and theme customization
